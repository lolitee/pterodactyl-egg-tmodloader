# pterodactyl-egg-tmodloader

literally fixed this because https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/game_eggs/terraria/tmodloader which didnt work due to the new tmodloader update

mods and world files will be saved in tModLoader folder

some varriables have been removed such as difficulty, you will have to manually set it in serverconfig.txt
